#Some Technical details about switch-statements:

1) The value on which we switch must be of an integer, char, or an enumeration type.In particular, you cannot switch on a string.

2) The values in the case labels must be constant expressions . In particular, you cannot use a variable in a case label.

3) You cannot use the same value for two case labels.

4) You can use several case labels for a single case.
   Example:
	   switch(a){
		case '0':case'2':case'4':case'6':case'8':
		cout<<"is even\n";
		break;

5)Always terminate a case with a break, the compiler wont warn if you forget.
